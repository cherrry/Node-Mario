# N-Mario

## Background Story

In the good old days, only 1 Queen was kidnapped and only 1 Mario was needed to save the queen. Nowadays, we all know that there exists a N-Queen problem, so we need N-Mario to solve it.

## Idea

The game is a 2D platform sideÂ­scroller with multiple players. All players play the same stage simultaneously. All players start at the leftmost side of the stage. To clear a stage, the players must reach the goal at the rightmost side of the stage.

## Features

1. Real-time synchronized gameplay
2. Challenges that require players to cooperate or compete
3. Various obstacles, enemies and power-ups

## Programming Challenges

1. Physics engine (phaser.io)
2. Websocket (socket.io or pusher)

## Deployment Scenarios

1. Github Pages
2. AWS

## System Design

1. Multiple game rooms
2. Multiple players
